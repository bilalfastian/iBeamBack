# An Enterprise iPad App. for Private Social Network Communication


## 1.1 Purpose of Project
Information sharing, communication and collaboration are essential for successful planning and execution of projects. A typical organization uses many applications to execute their projects; information generated during the life of a project is spread across many applications which make sharing, communication and collaboration difficult .As there are so many people involved in projects and information sharing within team members becomes difficult which in turn affects the productivity. Projects need these communication tools and applications in a unified form that helps the team members to increase the productivity by sharing and collaboration.
We will write an application that contains the basic communication and project management tools to help the organization members to collaborate on their projects and documents. The basic purpose of this application is to enhance the productivity of team members and provide relevant information to relevant persons working on their relevant projects. It will store all projects information to make decision later on.
